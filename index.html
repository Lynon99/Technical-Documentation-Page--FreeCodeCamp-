            <p>Javascript is an object-oriented scripting language, meaning that functional pieces of code are stored in discrete entities called objects.
                Javascript comes with a variety of pre-built objects that provide functions such as math operations, using dates, and statments just to name a few.
                An advantage of using object-oriented programming (OOP) is that code can be built in a modular way which can easily be modified without having to start from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>OOP has the ability to extend the Javascript language beyond its basic functionality so that it can perform certain functions more effectively.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side Javascript extends the functionality of the core language by using objects to control a browser and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                    This allows users to interact with the various elements in an HTML page in a way that would not be possible with HTML and CSS alone.

                </li>
                <li>Server-side Javascript uses objects to extend the core language in such a way as to allow various actions and communication between a client and
                    a server. For example, server side extensions can allow an application to communicate with the database to retrieve information.

                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="javascript_and_java">
            <header>Javascript and Java</header>
            <p>Javascript and Java may sound similar, but they are quite different in a few ways.
                Javascript follows some of Java expression syntax, naming conventions, and control-flow
                constructs hence the similar names.
            </p>
            <p>However, Javascript supports a simpler environment that is based on a smaller number of data types and has a prototype-based object model instead of 
                the class-based object model. Javascript is also alot more free-form than Java in that all the variables, classes, and methods don't need to be declared.
                
            </p>
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To write your first Javascript code we can start with a simple "Hello World" </p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Hello " + yourName);}
                greetMe("World");
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Variables function as symbolic names for values. The names that can be used to assign variables to values
                conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>In Javascript, variables must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign; digits 0-9 can also be used.
                However, Javascript is case sensitive, so variables must be called as they are declared.

            </p>
            <code>
                hello = "Hello"
                _lucky_num = 6
                $statment = 4 + 5
                
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <p>Scope refers to the availability of a variable to be accessed. When a variable is declared
                inside a function, it is considered local and can only be accessed within that variable.
                On the other hand, if a variable is declared outside of a function it is considered global
                and can be called anywhere in the code.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Constants are another example of scope. They are a declared variable that cannot be
                    declared or changed while the script is running. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Global variables are also properties of the global object, which is the window in the case
                    of web pages. Using window.variable can be used to access this global variable.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <code>
                hello_world = "Hello World!"
                window.hello_world
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="function_declarations">
            <header>Function Declarations</header>
            <p>A function is created using the "function" keyword followed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments for the function that are enclosed in parantheses
                    and separated by commas.
                </li>
                <li>The Javascript statments that define the function which are enclosed in curly braces.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here we have an example of a simple function called square and another function below it
                that takes two numbers as its argument and returns the product of them:
            </p>
            <code>
                function square(number) {
                    return number * number;
                }
            </code>

            <code>
                function compute(num1, num2) {
                    return num1 * num2;
                }
            </code>
