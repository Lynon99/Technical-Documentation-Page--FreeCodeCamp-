# Technical-Documentation-Page--FreeCodeCamp-
This is a simple technical documentation page I made for FreeCodeCamp's responsive web design certification project. It features media queries that adapt the page's
elements to fit the screen according to the device screen size. Other than that, it gives info on javascript, java, and object oriented programming with code samples.
The layout is a simple design using HTML and CSS.
